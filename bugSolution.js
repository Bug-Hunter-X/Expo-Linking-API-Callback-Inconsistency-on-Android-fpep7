The original code used `Linking.addEventListener` directly. The improved solution uses a combination of `Linking.getInitialURL` to capture the initial deep link at app launch and `Linking.addEventListener` with more robust error handling and potentially background services to ensure the deep link is always handled.  This might also include fallback mechanisms using other Android-specific deep link handling techniques like intents.
