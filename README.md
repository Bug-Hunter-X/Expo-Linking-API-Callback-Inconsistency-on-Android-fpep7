# Expo Linking API Callback Inconsistency on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the Expo `Linking` API's unreliability in triggering its callback function, specifically observed on Android devices.  The issue leads to a failure in processing deep links, preventing the app from responding appropriately to external URL invocations.

2. Run the app on an Android emulator or device.
3. Attempt to open a deep link targeting the application.  Observe that the callback function within `Linking.addEventListener` might not be called.

## Solution

The provided solution file `bugSolution.js` addresses this issue by employing alternative deep link handling strategies. It includes thorough error handling and potentially incorporates a background service for improved reliability.
